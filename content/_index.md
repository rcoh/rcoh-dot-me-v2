I'm a freelance software engineer specializing in backend infrastructure projects and improving engineering processes. I do pretty much everything but I'm most effective in Scala, Java, Python, Rust, and Go. I'm also well versed in porting architecture to Kubernetes.
I graduated from MIT in 2013 with a degree in Computer Science (6-3). Outside of work, I'm an avid paraglider pilot, rock climber, and cellist.
