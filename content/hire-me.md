If you're interested in hiring me for a contracting engagement, send me an email at `*@*.me` where `*` is rcoh. Please note that I'm only looking for contract work at the moment (no salaried, full-time).

I'm currently open to:

* Engagements from 1 week to 3 months
* Remote or onsite in the SF Bay Area

### Recent work

Software-wise, I do essentially everything, but I specialize in backend infrastructure projects. I can get onboarded quickly and I'm usually shipping code and adding value on the first day.

Recently, my work has fallen into two categories:

- Help design and ship backend projects
  - I helped [Nylas](https://nylas.com) deploy a [new, lower-latency webhooks delivery infrastructure](https://www.nylas.com/blog/-speeding-up-our-webhooks-system-60x)
   - I worked on the Kubernetes deployment system for [Kensho](https://kensho.com)
  - I built a DSL that compiles to Spark for [LogicHub](https://www.logichub.com/)
  - I helped a health startup use crypto properly


- Help _very early_ startups establish their tech stack while they're working on making their first technical hires. I've done it many times, so I know how to get it right the first time. I typically help with things like:
  - Setup Ansible/Terraform
  - Setup Kubernetes/Docker infrastructure
  - Continuous Integration / Deployment
  - SSL
  - Database migrations
  - Building developer culture of testing / code review etc.


If this sounds good, drop me a line! `*@*.me` where `*` is rcoh, or send me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/russellrcohen).
