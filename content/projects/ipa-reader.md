If you click on IPA (international phonetic alphabet) text on wikipedia, it links to a generic IPA page, which I always found frustrating. 
I created a [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wikipedia-ipa-speaker/jkgihpigffcfeebgedpklldebdibbnne) which adds a play button next to IPA text to read it aloud.

Done in an afternoon, it's almost certainly the highest users:time ratio of any project I've done. It simply extracts the IPA text from wikipedia and then uses Amazon Polly, a text-to-speech service provided by AWS to generate sound.
