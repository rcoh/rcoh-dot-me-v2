Written in Rust, [angle-grinder](https://github.com/rcoh/angle-grinder) enables sophisticated log file analysis from the terminal. Angle grinder is a distributed as a small, statically linked binary. That means it will run anywhere without dependencies so it's easy to install on whatever server your logs are on.
