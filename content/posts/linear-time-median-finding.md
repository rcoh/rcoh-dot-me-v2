Finding the median in a list seems like a trivial problem, but doing so in linear time turns out to be tricky. In this post I'm going to walk through one of my favorite algorithms, the median-of-medians approach to find the median of a list in deterministic linear time. Although proving that this algorithm runs in linear time is a bit tricky, this post is targeted at readers with only a basic level of algorithmic analysis.

### Finding the median in O(n log n)

The most straightforward way to find the median is to sort the list and just pick the median by its index. The fastest comparison-based sort is `O(n log n)`, so that dominates the runtime.[^2][^3]

```python
def nlogn_median(l):
    l = sorted(l)
    if len(l) % 2 == 1:
        return l[len(l) / 2]
    else:
        return 0.5 * (l[len(l) / 2 - 1] + l[len(l) / 2])
```

Although this method offers the simplest code, it's certainly not the fastest.

### Finding the median in average O(n)

Our next step will be to _usually_ find the median within linear time, assuming we don't get unlucky. This algorithm, called "quickselect", was devevloped by Tony Hoare who also invented the similarly-named quicksort. It's a recursive algorithm that can find any element (not just the median).

1. Pick an index in the list. It doesn't matter how you pick it, but choosing one at random works well in practice. The element at this index is called the **pivot**.
2. Split the list into 2 groups:
    1. Elements less than or equal to the pivot, `lesser_els`
    2. Elements strictly greater than the pivot, `great_els`
3. We know that one of these groups contains the median. Suppose we're looking for the *kth* element:
    - If there are *k* or more elements in `lesser_els`, recurse on list `lesser_els`, searching for the *kth* element.
    - If there are fewer than *k* elements in `lesser_els`, recurse on list `greater_els`. Instead of searching for *k*, we search for ```k-len(lesser_els)```.

Here's an example of the algorithm running on a list with 11 elements:
```
Consider the list below. We'd like to find the median.
l = [9,1,0,2,3,4,6,8,7,10,5]
len(l) == 11, so we're looking for the 6th smallest element
First, we must pick a pivot. We randomly select index 3.
The value at this index is 2.

Partitioning based on the pivot:
[1,0,2], [9,3,4,6,8,7,10,5]
We want the 6th element. 6-len(left) = 3, so we want
the third smallest element in the right array

We're now looking for third smallest element in the array below:
[9,3,4,6,8,7,10,5]
We pick an index at random to be our pivot.
We pick index 3, the value at which, l[3]=6

Partitioning based on the pivot:
[3,4,5,6] [9,7,10]
We want the 3rd smallest element, so we know it's the
3rd smallest element in the left array

We're now looking for the 3rd smallest in the array below:
[3,4,5,6]
We pick an index at random to be our pivot.
We pick index 1, the value at which, l[1]=4
Partitioning based on the pivot:
[3,4] [5,6]
We're looking for the item at index 3, so we know it's
the smallest in the right array.

We're now looking for the smallest element in the array below:
[5,6]

At this point, we can have a base case that chooses the larger
or smaller item based on the index.
We're looking for the smallest item, which is 5.
return 5
```

To find the median with quickselect, we'll extract quickselect as a separate function. Our `quickselect_median` function will call `quickselect` with the correct indices.
```python
import random
def quickselect_median(l, pivot_fn=random.choice):
    if len(l) % 2 == 1:
        return quickselect(l, len(l) / 2, pivot_fn)
    else:
        return 0.5 * (quickselect(l, len(l) / 2 - 1, pivot_fn) +
                      quickselect(l, len(l) / 2, pivot_fn))


def quickselect(l, k, pivot_fn):
    """
    Select the kth element in l (0 based)
    :param l: List of numerics
    :param k: Index
    :param pivot_fn: Function to choose a pivot, defaults to random.choice
    :return: The kth element of l
    """
    if len(l) == 1:
        assert k == 0
        return l[0]

    pivot = pivot_fn(l)

    lows = [el for el in l if el < pivot]
    highs = [el for el in l if el > pivot]
    pivots = [el for el in l if el == pivot]

    if k < len(lows):
        return quickselect(lows, k, pivot_fn)
    elif k < len(lows) + len(pivots):
        # We got lucky and guessed the median
        return pivots[0]
    else:
        return quickselect(highs, k - len(lows) - len(pivots), pivot_fn)
```

Quickselect excels in the real world: It has almost no overhead and operates in average `O(n)`. Let's prove it.

#### Proof of Average O(n)
On average, the pivot will split the list into 2 approximately equal-sized pieces. Therefore, each subsequent recursion operates on 1/2 the data of the previous step.

$$C=n+\frac{n}{2}+\frac{n}{4}+\frac{n}{8}+...=2n=O(n)$$

There are many ways to prove that this series converges to 2n. Rather than reproducing one here, I'll just direct you to the excellent [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1/2_%2B_1/4_%2B_1/8_%2B_1/16_%2B_%E2%8B%AF) about this specific infinite series.

Quickselect gets us linear performance, but only in the average case. What if we aren't happy to be average, but instead want to guarantee that our algorithm is linear time, no matter what?

### Deterministic O(n)

In the section above, I described quickselect, an algorithm with _average_ `O(n)` performance. Average in this context means that, _on average_, the algorithm will run in `O(n)`. Technically, you could get extremely unlucky: at each step, you could pick the largest element as your pivot. Each step would only remove one element from the list and you'd actually have `O(n^2)` performance instead of `O(n)`.

With that in mind, what follows is an algorithm for _picking pivots_. Our goal will be to pick a pivot in linear time that removes enough elements in the worst case to provide `O(n)` performance when used with quickselect. This algorithm was originally developed in 1973 by the mouthful of Blum, Floyd, Pratt, Rivest, and Tarjan. If my treatment is unsatisfying, their [1973 paper](http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/BFPRT73.pdf) will certainly be sufficient. Rather than walk through the algorithm in prose, I've heavily annotated my Python
implementation below:

```python
def pick_pivot(l):
    """
    Pick a good pivot within l, a list of numbers
    This algorithm runs in O(n) time.
    """
    assert len(l) > 0

    # If there are < 5 items, just return the median
    if len(l) < 5:
        # In this case, we fall back on the first median function we wrote.
        # Since we only run this on a list of 5 or fewer items, it doesn't
        # depend on the length of the input and can be considered constant
        # time.
        return nlogn_median(l)

    # First, we'll split `l` into groups of 5 items. O(n)
    chunks = chunked(l, 5)

    # For simplicity, we can drop any chunks that aren't full. O(n)
    full_chunks = [chunk for chunk in chunks if len(chunk) == 5]


    # Next, we sort each chunk. Each group is a fixed length, so each sort
    # takes constant time. Since we have n/5 chunks, this operation
    # is also O(n)
    sorted_groups = [sorted(chunk) for chunk in full_chunks]

    # The median of each chunk is at index 2
    medians = [chunk[2] for chunk in sorted_groups]

    # It's a bit circular, but I'm about to prove that finding
    # the median of a list can be done in provably O(n).
    # Finding the median of a list of length n/5 is a subproblem of size n/5
    # and this recursive call will be accounted for in our analysis.
    # We pass pick_pivot, our current function, as the pivot builder to
    # quickselect. O(n)
    median_of_medians = quickselect_median(medians, pick_pivot)
    return median_of_medians

def chunked(l, chunk_size):
    """Split list `l` it to chunks of `chunk_size` elements."""
    return [l[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(l), chunk_size)]
```

Let's prove why the median-of-medians is a good pivot. To help, consider this visualization of our pivot-selection algorithm:

![Pivot selection visualization](/images/median-of-medians.svg)

The red oval denotes the medians of the chunks, and the center circle denotes the median-of-medians. Recall that we want our pivot to split the list as evenly as possible. In the worst possible case, every element in the blue rectangle (top left) will be less than or equal to our pivot. The top right quadrant contains 3/5 of half of the rows -- `3/5*1/2=3/10`. So, we'll always drop at least 30% of the rows at each step.

But is dropping 30% of the elements at each step sufficient? At each step, our algorithm must do:

- O(n) work to partition the elements
- Solve 1 subproblem 7/10 the size of the original to recurse
- Solve 1 subproblem 1/5 the size of the original to compute the median of medians

This yields the following equation for the total runtime, `T(n)`:

$$T(n)=T(\frac{n}{5}\)+7T(\frac{n}{10})+n$$

It's not straightforward to prove why this is `O(n)`. A quick solution is to defer to the [Master Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)#Generic_form). We fall into case 3 of the master theorem where the work at each level dominates the work of the subproblems. In this case, our total work is just the work at each level, `O(n)`.

### Recap
We have quickselect, an algorithm that can find the median in linear time given a sufficiently good pivot. We have our median-of-medians algorithm, an `O(n)` algorithm to select a pivot (which is good enough for quickselect). Combining the two, we have an algorithm to find the median (or the nth element of a list) in linear time!

### Linear Time Medians In Practice
In the real world, selecting a median at random is almost always sufficient. Although the median-of-medians approach is still linear time, it just takes too long to compute in practice. The `C++` standard library uses an algorithm called [introselect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introselect) which utilizes a combination of heapselect and quickselect and has an `O(n log n)` bound. Introselect allows you to use a generally fast algorithm with a poor upper bound in combination with an algorithm that is slower in practice but has a good upper bound. Implementations start with the fast algorithm, but fall back to the slower algorithm if they're unable to pick effective pivots.

To finish out, here's a comparison of the elements considered by each implementation. This isn't runtime performance, but instead the total number of elements looked at by the quickselect function. It doesn't count the work to compute the median-of-medians. The point of this graph **is not** to demonstrate that median-of-medians is a good algorithm, but rather to demonstrate that it's an effective way to pick pivots.

It's exactly what you would expect! The deterministic pivot almost always considers fewer elements in quickselect than the random pivot. Sometimes we get lucky and guess the pivot on the first try, which manifests itself as dips in the green line. Math works!

P.S: In 2017 a [new paper](http://erdani.com/research/sea2017.pdf) came out that actually makes the median-of-medians approach competitive with other selection algorithms. Thanks to the paper's author, Andrei Alexandrescu for bringing it to my attention!

Thanks to Leah Alpert for reading drafts of this post. Reddit users `axjv` and `linkazoid` pointed out that `9` mysteriously disappeared in my example which has since been fixed.
